# Arduino Uno R4 WiFi Projects

This repository contains a collection of five exciting projects for the **Arduino Uno R4 WiFi** board. Each project demonstrates creative use of the **Arduino_LED_Matrix** library and explores unique patterns, algorithms, and visualizations. The code for these projects is optimized for an 8x12 LED matrix display.

## Projects

### 1. **Spiral Visualizer**
Generates mesmerizing spiral patterns that rotate and evolve over time. Multiple arms of the spiral move with organic motion, creating dynamic and beautiful effects.


### 2. **Drunkard's Walk Simulator**
Simulates a random walk across the LED matrix. The "drunkard" leaves a fading trail behind as it moves randomly in all directions.

### 3. **Wave Interference Pattern**
Displays interference patterns generated by two wave sources. This project beautifully demonstrates constructive and destructive wave interference on the LED matrix.

### 4. **Quantum Teleporter**
Simulates quantum teleportation effects between two points on the matrix. The animation includes quantum interference, entanglement, and teleportation phase transitions.

### 5. **Recamán Sequence Visualizer**
Visualizes the Recamán sequence, a fascinating mathematical sequence, as a path drawn across the LED matrix.
